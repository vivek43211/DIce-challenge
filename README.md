<p> 
I recently completed the Dice Challenge, an interactive, responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to roll virtual dice, generating random numbers dynamically linked to dice images. The results—win, lose, or draw—are determined and displayed in real time using advanced JavaScript techniques, including Math.random(), Math.floor(), DOM manipulation (querySelector, innerHTML, setAttribute), and efficient game logic. This project demonstrates my expertise in crafting dynamic, user-friendly interfaces with clean, responsive design.I recently completed the Dice Challenge, an interactive, responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
